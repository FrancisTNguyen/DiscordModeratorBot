Multi-purpose Discord Bot
Objective: This project deals with a multi-purpose 'bot' created for the group messaging app, Discord. With this said, the interface for this project is shown through the messaging app itself. The bot has been created to do multiple things and to try and serve the needs of the people within the channel. The main features for this bot include: cuss-filter, flipping a coin, and rolling dice. The cuss filter deletes messages that include cuss words in the group chat. The “flip coin” feature simply flips a virtual coin, giving heads or tails. Lastly, our “dice” feature rolls a dice from 1-6. These features help to regulate the group chat and solve simple disagreements. 
Discord has been growing exponentially in popularity, becoming more than just an app for gamers. Audiences for Discord have grown to also include college students, as well as people within the workplace. The target audience for this project includes children who are 12 and under; features such as the “cuss” feature help to keep their group chats PG. We hope to keep building on the bot to do more features, such as playing music and having mini-games for people to play. The source code for this project is primarily Python.
