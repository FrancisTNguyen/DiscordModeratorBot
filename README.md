# CS254: Multi-purpose Discord Bot
This project deals with a multi-purpose 'bot' created for the group messaging app, Discord. The bot has been created to do multiple things and to try and serve the needs of the people within the channel. Discord has been growing exponentially in popularity, becoming more than just an app for gamers. Audiences for Discord have grown to also include college students, as well as people within the workplace. We hope to keep building on the bot to do more features, such as re-calling previous songs that have been played, recommending similar songs, and including more mini-games for people to play.

Languages used: Python
CASE tools used: Github, Atom

This is a project by Francis Nguyen, Danielle Batalla, and Yushuo Lu.
